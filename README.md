# Sentiment-Analysis-With-Amazon-Reviews

The file 'amazon_reviews_sentiment_analysis.ipynb' is a file done through Google Colab that does the following:
Connect to Amazon Web Servers on Google Colab to read and store data of Amazon reviews, and preprocess the data to create sentiment features in order to fit classification models to predict the star rating of a review based on its text while optimizing running time. We compare various machine learning methods by referring to their runtime and accuracies (1 - the errors).

In the near future, I will attach an html version of the file as indicated at the bottom of the .ipynb file. Feel free to analyse and use the code for personal use. The code has been written by yours truly, much of it has been used from my university project from the course 'Big Data Mining (52002)' (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem).
